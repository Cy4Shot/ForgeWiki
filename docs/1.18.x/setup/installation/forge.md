# Setup - Installation

In this section of the tutorial we will be installing Minecraft Forge!
Forge is a **Mod Loader**, meaning it injects your mod into the game, allowing it to load.
It also provides an **API**, which simplifies a bunch of the modding process.

## Downloading Forge

1. Start by downloading Forge [here](/https://files.minecraftforge.net "Download Forge"){:target="_blank"}, picking your desired 1.18.x version from the dropdown list on the left. Select either the `Latest` or `Recommended` version. 
2. Click the **MDK** button and allow the waiting countdown from the top right of the advertisement to finish, then press *SKIP* to recieve your package.
3. Find a place to store your mod and extract the mdk zip file to it, then rename the unzipped folder to the name of your mod. *This folder is where your mod will be located for the rest of the tutorial!*

Congratulations, you've downloaded forge. Now time to configure it!
